# SearchPolicyDomains
- v. 0.1 — proof of concept.  If this works, and I'm not the only user, then I would consider the next level of development reasonably including but not limited to:
  - Multiple sources from which to scrape the domains of policy institutes
  - splitting it into multiple paste files for different scopes or disciplines
  - including R, Python, and/or Bash code for the user to update their own copies of the files.

My source for these domains is:
